		<p> One has to wonder if the modern coin will continue to exist for much longer given the rise of digital currencies and less reliance on metal coinage. Is it a good thing?
			It's difficult to say. Sure, it's probably easier to not mint mass amounts of coins, but sometimes it feels good to have coins. It makes you feel like $10 is worth
			$1000000. Coins feel heavy and make a nice clanking sound, or an annoying one. I say it's all about persepctive on whether or not we should keep coins. Either way,
			coins will live on even if in name only (e.g., Bitcoin).</p>
